### 👨‍🍳 **Cooking Steps**

1. **Prepare Seafood**:
   - Trim shrimp whiskers, butterfly cut, and devein. Scrub crabs clean and chop into pieces.
   - Soak shellfish in salt water to purge sand (about 2 hours), scrub repeatedly.
   - Marinate fish fillets with a little salt, cooking wine, and starch for 10 minutes to remove fishy smell and tenderize.

2. **Simmer the Soup Base**:
   - Add water or broth to the pot, add ginger slices, scallion knots, and your chosen soup base ingredients. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to low heat and simmer for 15 minutes to extract flavor.

3. **Cooking Order** (from hard to cook to easy to cook):
   - First add those that take longer: crab, shellfish, fish head/fish bones → cook for 5 minutes
   - Then add medium-cooking items: shrimp, squid, fish fillets → cook for 1-2 minutes
   - Finally add vegetables, tofu, vermicelli → cook until just done

4. **Enjoyment Tips**:
   - Seafood gets tough easily, avoid overcooking! Shrimp is done when it turns red and curls, fish fillets when they turn white.
   - Add soup while eating to maintain sufficient liquid and prevent burning.

### 💡 **Key Tips**

✅ **Choose Fresh Ingredients**: Live shrimp and crabs are best. Frozen seafood should be completely thawed and checked for any off odors.
✅ **Deodorizing is Key**: Shellfish must be thoroughly purged of sand; fish fillets marinated with cooking wine and ginger slices are more tender.
✅ **Don't Make the Soup Base Too Salty**: Seafood itself has a salty and fresh flavor, so the soup base seasoning should be light, relying on dipping sauces for flavor.
✅ **Safety First**: Crab and shellfish must be fully cooked before eating to avoid parasite risks.
✅ **Pair with Refreshing Drinks**: Chilled sour plum soup, lemon honey water, or refreshing beer make it even more enjoyable!
