    "# Gradio APP\n",
    "\n",
    "[Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/chatbot) is a Python package for quickly building web applications. With just a little code, you can develop applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "I developed an [Agent application](https://github.com/luochang212/dive-into-langgraph/tree/main/app) using Gradio. The result is as follows＼(`Δ')／\n",
    "\n",
    "![gradio-app](./app/images/gradio_app.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "> It supports web search, chart plotting, code execution, multi-step planning, automatic long-context compression ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone who has used Gradio knows that its frontend is not easy to adjust. Getting it to this state may not be perfect, but it's already a minimal and usable shell. There's nothing new on the backend; it mainly uses various technologies introduced in this guide, such as tools, MCP, middleware, multi-agent systems, and context engineering. The only pitfall I felt was the streaming output and incremental rendering of the Agent. To understand how LangChain handles asynchronous event streams, I spent a lot of time writing unit tests. Fortunately, it was all worth it, and I'm satisfied with the final product. Of course, the happiest part was getting my friends to use this application ✧\\(>o<)ﾉ✧\n",

    "## 3. Afterword\n",
    "\n",
    "In the article \"[Alibaba Releases New Quick BI, Talking About ChatBI's Underlying Architecture, Interaction Design, and Cloud Computing Ecosystem](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/He-04l46xJTM_MJ3AyTwWQ)\", I wrote some thoughts about Agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any product based on Agent technology is difficult to escape the limitations of current Agent technology.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> What are the limitations? Let me give a few examples:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. **Long-term Memory**: Refine useful conversations, forget useless ones, and improve Q&A effectiveness across conversations\n",
    "> 2. **Verification Capability**: Having memory alone is not enough; you also need to learn to judge, which is the ability of Verification\n",
    "> 3. **Knowledge System**: After having verification capabilities, you also need to use them to process memories into knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term memory, verification capability, knowledge system ... Half a year has passed, and progress on these things is still limited. But I'm quite optimistic; I think they are solvable in engineering, it's just a matter of how much they can generalize in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ten years ago, could you have imagined today's LLM? In fact, we have already obtained legendary-level technology and are approaching the truth of human intelligence at an unprecedented acceleration. It's just that whether this wave of technology can lead to AGI is still unknown. We who are in the midst of it are like characters driven by reinforcement learning, who must personally climb over mountains and valleys to get a signal about the direction forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the probability of AGI in the short term is small, because human intelligence is not so easily hacked. As long as AI's generalization is not as good as humans, human skills will spontaneously shift to places that have not yet been generalized. The good news is that work still needs us; the bad news is that we still need to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "With longing in heart, tread on plain shoes. Looking forward to meeting you again in a world where work is not needed ૮₍˶˘～˘˶₎ა\n",
