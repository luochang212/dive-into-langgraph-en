It is powerful, especially after the `v1.0` release, with comprehensive framework capabilities. `v1.0` is the stable version promised by the development team, and the API is expected to remain stable, making it a great time to learn.\n\n> According to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/langgraph/#history) records, `LangGraph 1.0.0` was released on October 18, 2025. It has only been a little over a month. Most code available today is based on `v0.6`, and this tutorial aims to bridge that gap.\n\n**1) Advantages of LangGraph**\n\nLangGraph is powerful. Memory, MCP, guardrails, state management, multi-agent — it has it all. Agent requirements are extremely complex, which can lead to framework code bloat and uncontrolled complexity. How does `LangGraph 1.0` solve this problem? It introduces **Middleware**, a new feature. Middleware is a hook function. By embedding middleware into workflows, efficient extension and customization can be achieved.\n\n**2) Advantages of This Tutorial**\n\nYou might ask, why read this when there's the [official documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)?\n\nHowever, this tutorial is an interactive Jupyter Notebook-based tutorial, with each chapter independently runnable. The official documentation often only provides core code snippets that cannot be run directly. That is to say, the official documentation focuses on conceptual explanations, while this tutorial focuses more on practical implementation.\n\n> Promise: This tutorial is entirely based on `LangGraph v1.0`, with no legacy `v0.6` code.\n\n## I.
