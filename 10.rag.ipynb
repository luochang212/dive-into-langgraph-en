    "\n",
    "Large language models have training data cutoff dates, so they don't know about events after that date. Additionally, their parameter limits prevent them from containing all professional knowledge. In other words, LLMs lack both real-time capabilities and specialized expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we make LLMs both real-time and professional? The easiest method is to let them \"cheat with notes.\" A **knowledge base** is like \"cheat notes\" for an LLM. Before answering a question, it first checks the notes to see if there's any content related to the question. If there is, it retrieves that content and combines it with the LLM's reasoning ability to generate the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"checking notes\" action is [**RAG**](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/retrieval) (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Using a knowledge base can make LLM responses evidence-based and reduce hallucinations, but the cost is the overhead of building and maintaining the knowledge base. Especially when the knowledge base is large, it's worth considering whether the cost is justified. After all, expanding the knowledge base to improve Agent performance is somewhat like \"using the finite to fight the infinite, using the certain to fight the uncertain.\" Although we often mention knowledge bases when talking about RAG, RAG is a retrieval technique that can retrieve anything. Compared to retrieving manually built knowledge bases, retrieving internet content or historical conversations is also possible and offers better value. Your next retrieval target doesn't necessarily have to be a knowledge base."

    "### 2.1 Text Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding is a technique that converts text into vectors. It takes a piece of text as input and outputs a fixed-length vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"I really like you\" --> [0.190012, 0.123555, .... ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of converting text to vectors is to map semantically similar words to the same vector space. Therefore, after converting a pair of synonyms into vectors, their vector distance is usually closer than other words. For example, \"football\" and \"basketball\" are closer in vector space, while \"football\" and \"basket\" are farther apart. The essence of Embedding is compression. From an encoding perspective, natural language contains redundant information. Embedding is equivalent to re-encoding natural language, expressing the most semantics with the fewest tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding also has advantages in multilingual scenarios. A well-trained Embedding model aligns multilingual content at the semantic level. That is, a vector can maintain the same semantics across multiple languages. This characteristic allows LLMs to be inclusive. Even when multilingual materials are added, they won't cause \"understanding\" confusion due to different literal words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Vector Retrieval Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Embedding models have the characteristic of training semantically similar words into nearby vectors, we can convert both the \"user question\" and \"knowledge base content\" into Embedding vectors. Then we calculate the distance between vectors. The smaller the vector distance, the higher the similarity between the texts. Using this principle, we can return the Top-K documents from the knowledge base with the smallest vector distance to the question vector.\n",

    "## 3. Vector Retrieval Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the above code can already calculate the similarity between knowledge base content and user questions, there are some issues in the engineering process:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Issue 2**: When the knowledge base is large, it's difficult to quickly retrieve Top-K relevant texts\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve **Issue 1**, we need text chunking: splitting the text in the knowledge base into uniformly sized chunks. Then use the Embedding model to convert these chunks into Embedding vectors. To ensure chunks don't lose semantics due to truncation, adjacent chunks should have some overlap. **Issue 2** is generally solved by introducing vector databases, which have mature [ANN](https://milvus.io/docs/single-vector-search.md) algorithms to help us quickly retrieve nearest neighbor vectors.\n",
