    "In this section, we will integrate MCP Server into LangGraph. Before integrating MCP Server, we must develop the MCP Server first. This is my specialty. In the article [\"New Wine in Old Bottles: Card Magic MCP\"](https://luochang212.github.io/posts/card_magic_mcp/), I have summarized an efficient development method. Below, I will use this method to create MCP Servers and then integrate them into LangGraph.\n",

    "> The complete code for creating MCP Servers is placed in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/luochang212/dive-into-langgraph/tree/main/mcp_server). Feel free to check it out if interested ＼(`Δ`)／\n",

    "Taking `get_weather_mcp` as an example, we want to write this MCP as a Python package. Of course, it's for local use only. If you want to upload it to PyPI, you certainly can, but that's a different process. Please refer to my blog post [\"PyPI Packaging Notes\"](https://luochang212.github.io/posts/pypi_packaging/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it recognized as a Python package, we need to create an `__init__.py` file under the project. Then write the main logic in `server.py`.\n",

    "That's all there is to it. Using `__main__.py` here has a clever purpose - it allows us to use this package directly as a module from the command line. What does this mean? It means that using `python -m [package_name]` is equivalent to directly running the special file `__main__.py`. Since we previously started the `http()` function in this special file, we can conveniently and quickly start the MCP Server! For our `get_weather_mcp`, the startup command is:\n",

    "[supervisord](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor) is a process management tool. You tell it which MCPs to run, and it will watch over your MCP babies. When an MCP crashes, supervisord can automatically restart it.
