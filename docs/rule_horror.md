# Shanghai Rule Horror

> You have arrived in Shanghai at night. The following rules must be strictly followed. Violators —— bear the consequences at your own risk.

**1. The Midnight Bell of the Bund**
At exactly midnight, if you happen to be standing on the Bund, do not look back within five minutes after hearing the bell. If you hear a familiar voice behind you, or feel a cold, wet hand touching your shoulder, no matter who the other party claims to be, never respond. Violators will forever become the echo of the bell.

**2. Strangers on the Subway**
After subway operations end, if you are still inside the carriage, a faceless passenger will appear. He will ask in a low voice: "Where are you going?" You can only report a Shanghai place name that truly exists. If you say a non-existent place name or remain silent, you will see your own corpse inside the carriage.

**3. Cats in the Alley**
Late at night, passing through an alley, when you encounter three black cats sitting side by side, you must take out all the change in your pocket and offer it on the ground, then walk through with your head down, never looking directly into the cat's eyes. Ignoring this, the cat's eyes will become eyes you can never open again.

**4. The Sound of the Huangpu River**
When the tide rises at night, if someone waves to you by the river, no matter how much they resemble someone important to you, you must never approach. Otherwise, you will be entangled by water weeds around your ankles and dragged into the river, never to be reborn for eternity.

**5. Reflections of Pudong Skyscrapers**
Between 23:33 and 23:44 late at night, do not look at your own reflection in the glass curtain walls of skyscrapers. If unfortunately you see it, and a third shadow appears behind you, you must immediately close your eyes and stand still, counting to 33. Otherwise, you will become the owner of the next reflection.

**6. The Unusual Taxi**
If after midnight you hail a taxi with a license plate full of 6s, please do not get in. If you have already gotten in, the driver will ask: "Do you like Shanghai?" No matter how you answer, the driver will grin and drive toward no-man's-land... until you become the next driver.
